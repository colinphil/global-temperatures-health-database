The following are proposed queries to be conducted between the primary and secondary datasets:

- This query would join the Health_Statistics and Country_Beam_DF on the countryName and Country attributes of the
respective tables and display the life expectancy and malnutrition rate over time for selected countries in Asia.
This would require altering the records of the Health_Statistics table to include a date column; 
i.e. shifting the year attributes to be compiled into a single attribute called date and just making a 
record for each year, rather than having each year be an attribute. Referential integrity would also have to be
checked with the Country_Beam_DF being the parent table.

- Another potential query would join the Life_Statistics and Urban_Growth_Statistics with the Country_Beam_DF table 
to display the change in urban population and the mortality rate for each country over time. It would require a 
similar transformation with changing each year to a record rather than attribute. This would be an interesting
visualization to determine if there is a correlation. 

-Another query would be joining the Population_Statistics and Date table, averaging all the country growth rates in 
the first table and joining on dates. This would be difficult as the Population_Statistics date attribute would
be just a year so we'd have to average the attributes of the Date table accordingly. This would once again 
require the transformation to make each record in the Population_Statistics table to have a single date attribute
rather than 55 columns for each year.
