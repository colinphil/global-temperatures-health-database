Primary Dataset: Global Surface Temperatures from 1743   

This dataset consists of surface land and ocean temperatures across the Earth split between towns, major cities, states,  
countries, and the entire globe. It consists of five files with dates ranging from 1743 to as late as 2015, making it
very feasible to analyze longterm global trends. We're interested in looking at temperature trends in certain areas of the 
globe and selecting a secondary dataset that contains regional particulate data. The goal is to see if there is a connection
between upticks of certain substances with regional surface land and ocean temperature.   

The files can be downloaded from Kaggle at the following link:

A quick note regarding the tables: all temperatures are in Celsius and follow the year-month-date pattern.

The first file is GlobalLandTemperaturesByCity.csv; its seven attributes are shown in the sample from the data:
dt	         AverageTemperature	   AverageTemperatureUncertainty	City	Country	 Latitude   Longitude
1743-11-01	 6.068	                   1.737	                        Århus	Denmark	 57.05N	    10.33E
1744-04-01	 5.788	                   3.624	                        Århus	Denmark	 57.05N	    10.33E

The second file is an extension of the previous, compiling it by country in GlobalLandTemperaturesByCountry.csv:
dt             AverageTemperature        AverageTemperatureUncertainty        Country
1743-11-01     4.384	                 2.294                                Åland
1744-04-01     1.53                      4.68                                 Åland

1744-07-01     15.342                    1.41                                 Åland

The third file is a collection of temperature data from major cities in GlobalLandTemperaturesbyMajorCity.csv:
dt             AverageTemperature        AverageTemperatureUncertainty  City	   Country        Latitude  Longitude
1849-01-01     26.704	                 1.435                          Abidjan    Côte D'Ivoire  5.63N     3.23W
1849-02-01     27.434                    1.362                          Abidjan    Côte D'Ivoire  5.63N     3.23W

Some shared attributes are dates (dt), averageTemperature and AverageTemperatureUncertainty between all the files. As there
is a clear hierarchy between city, major city, state, and country, there is a potential for creating a one-to-many 
relationship between the country file and the others. 


Secondary Dataset: Health Nutrition and Population Statistics

This dataset contains nutrition and population statistics across various demographics for countries starting from 1960 to 2015. 
It consists of various metrics of health that will be prioritized and split up into different tables. 
There is only 1 43 MB file of 89,010 records and a considerable amount of processing will be necessary to create tables 
for metrics of interest. The attributes are the metrics tracked, the country, and the years from 1960 to 2015. 

The file can be downloaded from Kaggle at the following link:
https://www.kaggle.com/theworldbank/health-nutrition-and-population-statistics

A quick note regarding these statistics: all rates are in for per 1000 people, unless specified as a percentage. 

The HealthNutrition.csv file has 59 attributes; a sample is shown below for only the first three years:
